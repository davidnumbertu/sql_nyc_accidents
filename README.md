New York City collisions report and datalog from 2005-2023.

## Overview
This is the capstone project of INST490, the final course of the Information Science Major at the University of Maryland. As part of one of five teams that mirror a real consulting company, my work showcases data analysis techniques including usage of Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Tableau, and methods of Data Calibration and Validation in regards to Crimes of Hate Bias in the state of Maryland.

## Data Sources
- All data was taken from the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center (https://mcac.maryland.gov/resources/) (PDFs manually converted to CSV)
- Cleaned using Google Sheets and then imported as a CSV file to Excel
- Final dataset consists of County Data, State-Wide Data, and Bias Motivation Reports.

## Technologies Used

## Results
- Found that more urban counties in Maryland were displaying 33% more reports of hate bias crime than rural counties on a yearly basis.
- Initially concluded that urban counties required more help and resources to combat hate bias. However, upon further analysis, the issue did not lie within urban populations but the rural ones; rural counties had comparitively less resources and openness for reporting these crimes.
- Motioned GOCI to allocate time and resources for rural counties and investigate why reporting data is so low in those counties, rather than focus on urban counties that are consistently reporting bias crime
