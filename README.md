# sql_nyc_accidents
New York City collisions report and datalog from 2005-2023.

## Overview
This is my final project of INST327, a course at the University of Maryland covering SQL and database modeling. Working with a team of five people, our tasks include normalization of the dataset, importing the dataset into MySQL server, writing queries to fetch key data, and using written queries to answer questions in regard to collisions and the nature of reporting.
